# metadataMaker
## Introduction

In this project, we explore the topic of classifying papers according to categories with a paper's abstract as input. Originally, we seeked to generate metadata, such as keyphrases, from the abstract of an article, but we found paper classification alone to be nontrivial. With that, we explore different architectures using various text representations and compare performances within the space of academic literature abstracts.
